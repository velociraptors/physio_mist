\section{System Features}

\subsection{Import Existing Models}

\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will be able to import models that have been previously created in the JSim standard.
Priority = High.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

Stimulus: User locates a JSim file he or she wants to upload.
Response: System converts the file to its preferred format for further use.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
Upload.check: Determine if the file is in the JSim format.
Upload.convert: Convert the file to the system's format.

etc. etc. Barbie, you already did this stuff, right?  Could you list whatever your functions were here so we don't have to change it later?

\subsection{Save Anatomical Information}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will save anatomical information associated with model components.  Priority = High.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

Stimulus: User requests to save anatomical information.
Response: Information is saved on user's hard drive.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
Save.Request: Once the user has clicked the save button in the GUI, the system will save the anatomical information for the currently displayed model in a pre-determined location on the user's hard drive.


\subsection{Integrate Model Components on a One-to-One Basis}

\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will provide a graphical interface for users to integrate components from two models on a one-to-one basis.  Priority = High.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
Stimulus: User inputs two models to the system.
Response: System integrates the components of these models and displays the result.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
OnetoOne.Integrate: The system will use the one-to-one algorithm to integrate the two models.

\subsection{Integrate Model Components on a One-to-Many Basis}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will provide a graphical interface for users to integrate components from several models on a one-to-many basis.  Priorty = Low.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

Stimulus: User inputs multiple models to the system and specifies that the first should be integrated with all the rest.
Response: System integrates the components of these models and displays the result.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

Onetomany.Integrate: The system will use the one-to-many algorithm to integrate the models.

\subsection{Integrate Model Components on a Many-to-One Basis}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will provide a graphical interface for users to integrate components from several models on a many-to-one basis.  Priorty = Low.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

Stimulus: User inputs multiple models to the system and specifies that the last should be integrated with all the rest.
Rsponse: System integrates the components of these models and displays the result.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

ManytoOne.Integrate: The system will use the many-to-one algorithm to integrate the models.

\subsection{Display Simulation Results}

\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
The system will provide a robust representation of the information contained in simulation results.  Priority = Low.

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}

Stimulus: User integrates models on a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-one basis.
Response: Display the results of the comparison graphically.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

Display.onetoone: The system will graphically show the results of a one-to-one comparison.
Display.onetomany: The system will graphically show the results of a one-to-many comparison.
Display.manytoone: The system will graphically show the results of a many-to-one comparison.
